==== 3 How to implement CDC Communications, in your Atmel C/C++ Application ====
  -In Atmel Studio 5, create your Visual Studio solution ( a solution may consist of several projects ) and Visual Studio project for your application, plus an extra static library project "avrstdio" for the Stdio redirection functions.
  -Select "File / New / Example Project... ", "Show Projects = AVR XMEGA, 8-bit" and add the "C" demo project [[http://asf.atmel.com/docs/2.6.1/common/services/usb/class/cdc/device/example/atxmega256a3bu_xmega_a3bu_xplained/doxygen/html/|Atmel Corporation "USB Device CDC Example for XMEGA-A3BU Xplained / ASF USB Device CDC"]] to your solution, to have sample code and to learn which drivers and which initialisation code you need. 
  -As you can´t transform a "C" project in a "C++" project with Atmel AVR Studio 5, currrently, you must start from scratch to build your own C++ applications, by importing needed ASF drivers to your empty project.
  -Load the ASF drivers into your application project.
    *"IOPORT - Input/Output Port Controller (Driver)".
    *"UTILITY - Generic board support (Driver)".
    *"GFX Monochrome - Monochrome Graphic Library (Service)".
    *"GFX Monochrome - System Font (Service)".
    *"GPIO - General purpose Input/Output (Service)".
    *"USB CDC (Single Interface Device) (Service)".
  -Load the ASF drivers into your optional "avrstdio" library project.
    *"IOPORT - Input/Output Port Controller (Driver)".
    *"UTILITY - Generic board support (Driver)".
    *"GPIO - General purpose Input/Output (Service)".
    *"USB CDC (Single Interface Device) (Service)".
  -In Atmel Studio 5, modify the project files "src / config / conf_clock.h", by including the USB configuration definitions next to "CONFIGURATION WITH USB", both of the application project and the "avrstdio" project<code>
// ***************************************************************
// **                  CONFIGURATION WITH USB                   **
// ***************************************************************
//! The following clock configuraiton can be used for USB operation
//! It allows to operate USB using On-Chip RC oscillator at 48MHz
//! The RC oscillator is calibrated via USB Start Of Frame
//! Clk USB     = 48MHz (used by USB)
//! Clk sys     = 48MHz
//! Clk cpu/per = 24MHz
#define CONFIG_USBCLK_SOURCE     USBCLK_SRC_RCOSC
#define CONFIG_OSC_RC32_CAL      48000000UL
#define CONFIG_OSC_AUTOCAL          OSC_ID_RC32MHZ
#define CONFIG_OSC_AUTOCAL_REF_OSC  OSC_ID_USBSOF
#define CONFIG_SYSCLK_SOURCE     SYSCLK_SRC_RC32MHZ
#define CONFIG_SYSCLK_PSADIV     SYSCLK_PSADIV_2
#define CONFIG_SYSCLK_PSBCDIV    SYSCLK_PSBCDIV_1_1</code>
  -In Atmel Studio 5, modify the project files "src / config / conf_usb.h", by including the USB configuration definitions next to "Device definition (mandatory)", both of the application project and the "avrstdio" project<code>
//! Device definition (mandatory)
#define  USB_DEVICE_VENDOR_ID             0x03EB
#define  USB_DEVICE_PRODUCT_ID            0x2404</code>
==== 4 How to direct Stdin / Stdout Communications to CDC, in your Atmel C/C++ Application ====
=== 4.1 Description ===
  *You can either keep the Stdio routines within your application code, or deposit it in an external library. Of course for separate compilation, you need to load the ASF in the library project too. 
  *Be careful not to do double initialisation, and with deinitalisation ! For experimental purposes, I included deinitialisation code in the function "avrstdio_stop()", as comments.
  *The files "avrstdio.h", "avrstdio.c" for the external library are not printed here. It is the same code, just with different function names.
  *So with this sample code, just calling "udc_start()" and "udc_attach()" is ok even if the files "avrstdio.h", "avrstdio.c" are kept in an external library.
  *As output of the ASF software module "Unit test framework" is directed to Stdout, you get all output of your testing framework on your Windows host terminal, as additional benefit :-)

==== 5 How to configure the Windows Host for CDC Communications ====
=== 5.1 Install the Windows setup information file for a CDC device ===
  *Upoad of the application with CDC communications on the Atmel board.
  *By the USB connection, Windows detects a new hardware. Follow the instructions to install the "Windows setup information file for a CDC device".
=== 5.2 Confgure PuTTY to convert the CR output of a CDC Application to a CR, LF ===
  *Issue: With CDC applications and [[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/|PuTTY]] as terminal application, output of "\n" like with "udi_cdc_write_buf("Hello\n", sizeof("Hello\n"))" should move the cursor to a new line, but it does not.
  *Solution: "PuTTY Configuration / Terminal", "Options controlling the terminal emulation": Set the option "[x] Implicit CR in every LF".
=== 5.3 How to start a CDC application on Windows Host with PuTTY & Atmel Target ===
  *Procedure:
    -Open the device manager of Windows ( "Start / Settings / Control Panel / System / Hardware / Device Manager".
    -With AVR Studio 5, load a project and start the debugging process by ALT+F5 ( "Start Debugging and Break" ).
    -If necessary, press the button "Continue" in With AVR Studio 5.
    -Wait until you that the COM port ( e.g "COM16:", "COM21:"... ) is listed in the Windows device manager, by an automatic refresh.
    -Execute PuTTY.
      *Configure PuTTY to use the proper COM port. Save this configuration.
      *Load a proper configuration. Best is to configure the default session, which is loaded automatically at start. 
      *You have to start PuTTY for new, at each run of your CDC application.
    -Start terminal emulation of PuTTY by pressing the button "Open".
==== 6 Operation Instructions ====
  *Start the application from within Atmel Studio 5.
  *Open the terminal application on the Windows host computer, as described in (5).
  *Press any key in the terminal window of your Windows host computer.
  *This causes the application to output data both on the graphics display and the terminal.
==== 7 Restrictions with CDC Communications ====
=== 7.1 Please wait for a Keypress to start CDC Communications ===
  *Problem: If your Atmel application starts with an output of "Hello World!" by CDC, you won´t see that on the Windows host terminal - it is lost. Indeed, about 6400 udi_cdc_getc() keyboard inputs requests ( and the equivalent amount of output messages ) are lost too.
  *Solution: Let your Atmel software wait for a real keypress ( a non-zero result of udi_cdc_getc() ), 
    *Like this with an ASF call :<code>
int aKeyboardInput = 0;
while (aKeyboardInput == 0) { aKeyboardInput = udi_cdc_getc(); };</code>
    *Like this with a Stdio call :<code>
int aKeyboardInput = 0;
while (aKeyboardInput == 0) { aKeyboardInput = getchar(); };</code>
=== 7.2 Stopping at a Breakpoint breaks CDC Communications ===
  *The communciations between the [[http://store.atmel.com/PartDetail.aspx?q=p:10500293|Atmel AVR XMEGA-A3BU Xplained kit]] board and the Windows host computer is handled by the [[http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=17333|ATxmega256A3BU]] CPU.
  *Issue: If you stop the application in a breakpoint, the microcontroller can't execute the USB communication stack. This breaks the communication with the Windows host computer.
=== 7.3 No CDC Communications with a Windows host if Breakpoints are set ===
  *Issue: If I execute the application with Atmel AVR Studio 5 on Windows, there is a difference if I have breakpoints set ( in the application loop after setting up the CDC communication ), or not:
    *If I execute the application without setting breakpoints, the COM: port is created and communiction works fine.
    *If I execute the same application with breakpoints set, the COM: port is not created.
  *Commments by Atmel experts ( [[imprint.html|Feedback]] is welcomed warmly, especially if you have a different view ): 
    *This is a restriction in the CDC communication with windows. Note that You are using the built in Windows CDC driver and the .inf file you are installing tells Windows to use that driver when connected to this specific application.
    *When an application ( e.g. a terminal software ) opens a COM port with Windows, this COM port is hold open during the whole session to avoid that another application accesses this COM port. Probably due to avoid conflicts between applications. Since this port is virtual, it does not have a physical address ( such as classical COM ports ). Therefore when You stop the debug program, the virtual COM port will also go away.
    *But the terminal will still hold it anyway. This is something either on the Windows API side or the Terminal program implementation.
    *When you restart the debug program, the virtual COM port cannot be mounted anymore since it is still held by the terminal. Probably Atmel can`t do anything about it. This is due either to the CDC driver ( of Windows ), or the terminal program itself.
  *Recommended reading: 
    *[[http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc4322.pdf|Atmel "Migrating from RS-232 to USB Bridge Specification"]] ( PDF ).
=== 7.4 You can´t reopen CDC communications ===
  *Issues: By my C/C++ code running on the Atmel board, 
    *I am just able to open the CDC connection once. 
    *I may open and close a CDC connection. If I don´t deleay the closing of the CDC conection, some or even all output from the ATxmega target to the CDC connection might be lost and is never delivered to the CDC terminal computer.
    *I am not able to open a CDC connection successfully, after a previous open and close.
